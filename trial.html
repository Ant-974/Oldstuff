	<h1> This new page is gonna be about music</h1>

<main>
	<p> Since I really like music and its often something I'd use to uplift my mood, I thought "What about sharing some of the song I like to listen whist making a new page?".</p>

	<p> In general, I'd say i'm drown to reggae and dancehall music. I like a chilled vibes or something where I fancy dancing and showing some moves on the Dancefloor. However, I can also be very sensitive to lyrics. Some songs can be so meaningfull or can be quite deep , to the point where I can picture it in my head sometimes. So I believe like most people the content of a song can often make us listen to an something that wouldn't be our usual song.</p>

	<p>Enough reading now! It's time to listen:</p>

	<div id="links-song" >
	<ul>
		<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zgDXIi1uYw">Caraluna - Bacilos</a> </li>
		<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsFpUW48Tnc">King Without A Crown - Matisyahu</a> </li>
		<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afAKjGY5yFw">La Fleur Aux Dents - Joe Dassin</a> </li>

	</ul>

	<p>Is there any song you like to listen? If yes what about you pop me a message <a href="mailto:akbidi@laposte.net">here</a> so I can upload it and share it with others. I made the following rules to keep it entertaining: <br>
	<ol>
<div class="myDiv1">
	<li id="col1">You can only pick 3 songs</li>
	<li id="col2">Tell me why you picked this song. Is there a story to it maybe?</li>
	<li id="col3">Optional but if possible, pick three songs in a different language</li> 
	 </div>
	</ol>
	</p>
